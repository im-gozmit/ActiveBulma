# ActiveBulma
This tiny javascript file will activate your bulma css framework

Basicaly you can just drop this file into your project and it will work right off the box.

For the modal, you will need to call the `openModal()` function. For example:

`<button class="button is-danger is-outlined" onclick="openModal()">Press me to open modal</button>`
